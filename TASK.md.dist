# TASK.md - Project Development Plan

## PROJECT: [Project Name]
**Start Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Target Completion**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: [ Planning | In Progress | Review | Complete ]

## CRITICAL: Development Process

### Every Task/Phase MUST Follow This Process:
1. **Implementation**: Write the code/feature
2. **Initial Review**: Run review agent on the implementation
3. **Fix Issues**: Address all review feedback
4. **Re-Review**: Run review agent again with context of fixes
5. **Iterate**: Repeat steps 3-4 until review passes
   - Minimum: 2 review cycles (initial + verification)
   - Continue until: No issues found
   - Maximum: 10 review cycles (then escalate/document blockers)
6. **Only Then**: Mark task as complete and move to next

### Review Requirements:
- [ ] Code quality and best practices
- [ ] Security analysis
- [ ] Testing (actually run the code when possible)
- [ ] Documentation completeness
- [ ] Integration with existing code

### Review Context to Provide:
When running review agents, always provide:
- Purpose of the code
- Integration points with existing system
- Any special requirements or constraints
- Previous review feedback being addressed

## Template Usage Instructions

1. **Copy this file**: Save as `TASK.md` in your project root
2. **Fill in placeholders**: Replace all [bracketed] content
3. **Customize phases**: Add/remove phases as needed
4. **Track progress**: Update checkboxes and statuses as you work
5. **Document reviews**: Record all review cycles and fixes
6. **Add to .gitignore**: Add `TASK.md` to .gitignore to keep project-specific content private
7. **Keep template**: Leave `TASK.md.dist` in version control for future projects

### Best Practices
- Update this file daily during active development
- Use it as the source of truth for project status
- Review it in team meetings
- Archive completed TASK.md files for future reference
- Update the template based on lessons learned
